				<h2>BIO: All (or at Least Some) About Me <br><small>
					
						Most find it strange that I go by my middle name, Chris, but this is, I've come to realize, a family tradition that my Dad started.  Since he went by his middle name, Dennis, and since I share the same name as my first name, I was brought up going by Chris.  
<br></br>

						This is my 10th year at UF, and I'm excited to finally be finishing my undergrad (hopefully) this semester.  I grew up playing video games and have always wanted to be involved in making one, which I think is what sparked my interest in computers and technology.  We didn't have a computer in the house until I was in high school, and from that point on I've been endlessly intrigued.  
<br></br>

						I immediately started getting into digital art, learning as much as I could about Photoshop, After Effects, and Lightwave for 3D modeling.  I also started to learn a little in the way of how the software on the computer worked.  It was during high school that I was first exposed to the ideas of reverse engineering and assembly, but I had no experience with programming, and though I was trying to go through the motions, I was mostly waving my arms with little effect.  Somehow the late nights looking at crackmes, windbg, and how keygens worked stuck with me though.
<br></br>

						I learned as much as I could about computers in the short time between when we got our first and when I entered UF.  Any time something went wrong with the computer, my Dad would beckon me to find out how to fix it, and fix it I would.  I eventually got to the point where I was switching out RAM, HDD, and CPU, in addition to cleaning up the myriad viruses that somehow crept onto the computer.  Though I brushed up against programming frequently among my late-night webcrawling, I never took the plunge to try learning it in earnest.
<br></br>

						I decided that I should focus on the artistic pursuits since they seemed to have a lower barrier to entry (and were more visually stimulating), and entered UF in the DAS program.  I was nervous since, although I enjoyed the art forms I'd thus far pursued, I didn't feel that I had enough skill, and feared that I wouldn't find a niche that I could thrive in.  
<br></br>

						The excessive freedom obtained by leaving home combined with the disproportionate fun and distractions to be had at UF went to my head and I ended up washing out of the DAS program; I withdrew in 2007 after digging myself into 2 years worth of negligence and bad grades from weed-out classes. I ended up changing my major several times before being told that I could no longer return to the college of engineering and subsequently withdrawing.  
<br></br>

						I felt shame as I've never felt, that I disappointment my parents, that I was a failure, and that I couldn't accomplish graduating college as my father had.  My parents were not well off, and though I wasn't in class I decided to stay in Gainesville and get a job so I could learn to become self-sufficient.  I got a job working on campus at the UF Computing Help Desk, where I would find some semblance of success.
<br></br>

						I found the help desk to be transformative to my self esteem and confidence; it was the first environment in Gainesville in which I thrived.  They made an exception for my training track because of my proficiency with computers, and I was made technical consultant in two semesters.  The duties involved over-the-phone troubleshooting of computer/gatorlink account issues, as well as in-person assistance with laptop issues which ranged from hardware installation, hardware diagnoses, software installation/diagnoses, to malware removal and eventually workflow scripting and retooling.   
<br></br>

						It was during this time that I gained a better ability to talk to strangers, and to conduct myself in a more professional manner.  Above all though, my interest and knowledge about computer software and computer security began to take root and grow.  I became very interested in how malware worked, and took it upon myself to taking the time to understand the mechanisms by which malware operated.  My effort put into learning (albeit at a high level) about how malware in general functioned lent me an uncanny ability to solve our client's issues related to them.  
<br></br>

						One of my coworkers mentioned to me one time about this person John Sawyer who used to work for UF at IT Security and about these competitions called Capture The Flag (CTF) events, which were basically hacking competitions.  I was intrigued beyond compare.  
<br></br>

						It was around this time in 2008 that my father's illness began to take its toll.  He had contracted Hepatitis C when he was in Gainesville for college back in the 60's, and had kept pretty good control of it up to this point in life.  It was around this time that the Help Desk promoted me to a full-time Staff Member and I was elated to hold my second “real” job doing something I enjoyed.  I decided at this point that I would return to school and earn my degree; I felt that I had obtained an amount of composure and focus sufficient to succeed this time around.  I also wanted to make my Mom, Dad, and Brother proud.
<br></br>

						In 2010 my father's illness progressed to end-stage cancer and he passed away.  Our family was shattered, and we were all devastated.  We lost our home, and my brother and mother are now moving from place to place trying to make ends meet.  I've remained in Gainesville and call this town my home.  After 6 months as a staff member, my schooling was paid for by Academic Technology and I was readmitted as a Philosophy major.  I planned to graduate with a Computer Science degree, but lacked the critical tracking to be accepted into that major.
<br></br>

						  I worked with the college for several years after this, taking classes part time, trying to accomplish what I set out to do, to make my Mother and Brother, as well as myself, proud.  after several more years of working and attending school part-time, the Help Desk began a descent into becoming a toxic workplace. This, combined with my depression over losing my Dad, led to me quitting in 2014 so that I could attend school full-time and dedicate myself to finishing school. 
<br></br>

						It was during this latter half of my Help Desk employ that I learned the fundaments of programming, and became a member of the Student Infosec Team.  I actually got to meet John Sawyer, and he's become a role model of the success I hope to achieve.  I eventually became treasurer of the SIT club, and continued taking computer science courses along my philosophy ones in order to eventually be able to switch my major.
<br></br>

						Due to lack of funds I obtained a part-time position in august of 2014, and finally was able to switch my major in 2015 to Computer Science.  I felt as if a major milestone had been reached.  It was at this same time that I was contacted by the UF Information Security office to become an intern there.  I immediately jumped at the opportunity, and have been working there since January, learning about enterprise security alongside finishing my Computer Science undergraduate degree.  
<br></br>

						I'm now working on attaining the knowledge and skills necessary to get into Enterprise Pen-testing, reverse engineering, and possibly the cryptography subdomains of the computer security field, and I plan to continue working at UF IT Security after I graduate. In my spare time I like to play video games as well as design them, learn about computer security, and play Go.  I plan on making at least one successful masterpiece of a (video) game in my non-working hours.</small></br></h2>
